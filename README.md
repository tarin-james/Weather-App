# Overview

This is a program that I created using javascript Api's that find the current weather of any given coordinates. It wil provide the name of the city entered, the current weather, and then the forecasted weather for the next day at 3:00.

# Future Work

- I need to make it so that an error page pops up if the network doesn't work
- A loading wheel would look very nice as the information is fetched
- Improve the html and css quality
